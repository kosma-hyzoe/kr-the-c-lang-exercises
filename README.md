# Learning C

My materials for learning C.

> C is a Spartan language, and so should your naming be. Unlike Modula-2 and
>Pascal programmers, C programmers do not use cute names like
>ThisVariableIsATemporaryCounter. A C programmer would call that variable tmp,
>which is much easier to write, and not the least more difficult to understand.
